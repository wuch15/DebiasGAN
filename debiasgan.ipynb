Cosmic Pretzel The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) captured this unprecedented image of two circumstellar disks, in which baby stars are growing, feeding with material from their surrounding birth disk. The complex network of dust structures distributed in spiral shapes remind of the loops of a pretzel. These observations shed new light on the earliest phases of the lives of stars and help astronomers determine the conditions in which binary stars are born. Iberian Nights The Iberian Peninsula at night, showing Spain and Portugal. Madrid is the bright spot just above the center. Dark World This artist\\'s illustration depicts the exoplanet LHS 3844b, which is 1.3 times the mass of Earth and orbits an M dwarf star. The planet\\'s surface may be covered mostly in dark lava rock, with no apparent atmosphere, according to observations by NASA\\'s Spitzer Space Telescope. Dried Martian River Bed This image from ESA s Mars Express shows a dried-up river valley on Mars named Nirgal Vallis. This oblique perspective view was generated using a digital terrain model and Mars Express data gathered on Nov. 16, 2018 during Mars Express orbit 18818. Snakes and Stones The galaxy pictured in this Hubble Picture of the Week has an especially evocative name: the Medusa merger. Often referred to by its somewhat drier New General Catalogue designation of NGC 4194, this was not always one entity, but two. An early galaxy consumed a smaller gas-rich system, throwing out streams of stars and dust out into space. These streams, seen rising from the top of the merger galaxy, resembles the writhing snakes that Medusa, a monster in ancient Greek mythology, famously had on her head in place of hair, lending the object its intriguing name. The legend of Medusa also held that anyone who saw her face would transform into stone. In this case, you can feast your eyes without fear on the centre of the merging galaxies, a region known as Medusa\\'s eye. All the cool gas pooling here has triggered a burst of star formation, causing it to stand out brightly against the dark cosmic backdrop. The Medusa merger is located about 130 million light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major (The Great Bear). The Center of the Milky Way The center of the Milky Way galaxy is hidden from the prying eyes of optical telescopes by clouds of obscuring dust and gas. But in this stunning vista, the Spitzer Space Telescope\\'s infrared cameras penetrate much of the dust, revealing the stars of the crowded galactic center region. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will offer a much-improved infrared view, teasing out fainter stars and sharper details. Once in a Blue Comet This image features a comet located in the outer reaches of the Solar System: comet C/2016 R2 (PANSTARRS). As its name suggests, the comet was discovered in 2016 by the Pan-STARRS telescopes in Hawai i. The new image seen here was captured by a project based at ESO s Paranal Observatory in Chile named the Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars   or SPECULOOS for short. Out for a (Space) Walk After completing the first of 10 spacewalks to upgrade the station, astronaut Christina Koch wrote: \"The great @Space_Station battery swap series of spacewalks is underway! A joy & privilege working with @AstroDrewMorgan outside, @astro_luca as the lead for suits & airlock, @Astro_Jessica as robotic arm operator, & the incredible teams in Houston. 3 batteries complete, 9 to go!\" Asteroid probe In this Oct. 3 image released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the rover MINERVA-II2 is captured immediately after separation. Japan\\'s space agency says the small rover will land on the surface of an asteroid as part its final mission before heading back to Earth. A launch from above From aboard the International Space Station, Expedition 60 astronaut Christina Koch photographed the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft ascending into space after its launch from Kazakhstan on Sept. 25, 2019. After a four-orbit, six-hour journey, the Soyuz docked to the Space Station with NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and spaceflight participant Hazzaa Ali Almansoori of the United Arab Emirates joining the crew. Spitzer spots bubbles This infrared image from NASA\\'s Spitzer Space Telescope shows a cloud of gas and dust full of bubbles, which are inflated by wind and radiation from young, massive stars. Each bubble is about 10 to 30 light-years across and filled with hundreds to thousands of stars. The region lies in the Milky Way galaxy, in the constellation Aquila (aka the Eagle). The lunar highlands The Chandrayaan-2 lander, Vikram, attempted a landing Sept. 7 (Sept. 6 in the United States), on a small patch of lunar highland smooth plains between Simpelius N and Manzinus C craters. A last look As astronaut Nick Hague prepares to conclude his stay aboard the orbiting laboratory this week, he shared this photo saying: \"Today is my last Monday living on this orbiting laboratory and I m soaking up my final views. The @Space_Station is truly an engineering marvel. #MondayMotivation.\" Hague will return to Earth after a six-month stay aboard the International Space Station. He and Expedition 60 and Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos\\u200b are completing a 203-day mission, spanning 3,248 orbits of Earth, and a journey of 80.8 million miles. Hague is completing his second flight in space totaling 203 days, while Ovchinin will have logged 375 days in space on his third flight at the time of landing. Starship\\'s starry-eyed ambitions Space enthusiasts look at a prototype of SpaceX\\'s Starship spacecraft at the company\\'s Texas launch facility on Sept. 28 in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas. The Starship spacecraft is a massive vehicle meant to take people to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Hunting black holes In our vast universe, the heaviest black holes grew from seeds. Nourished by the gas and dust they consume, or by merging with other dense objects, these seeds grow in size and heft to form the centers of galaxies, such as our own Milky Way. But unlike in the realm of plants, the seeds of giant black holes must have been black holes, too. And no one has ever found these seeds   yet. One idea is that supermassive black holes   the equivalent of hundreds of thousands to billions of Suns in mass   grew from a population of smaller black holes that has never been seen. This elusive group, the \"intermediate-mass black holes,\" would weigh in somewhere between 100 and 100,000 Suns. Among the hundreds of black holes found so far, there have been plenty of relatively small ones, but none for sure in the intermediate mass-range \"desert.\" In this image, a galaxy called ESO 243-49 is home to an extremely bright object called HLX-1. Circled in this image, HLX-1 is the most likely example of a black hole in the intermediate mass range that scientists have found. Moon shadow Jupiter\\'s volcanically active moon, \"lo,\" casts its shadow on the planet in this dramatic image from NASA\\'s Juno spacecraft. As with solar eclipses on the Earth, within the dark circle racing across Jupiter\\'s cloud tops one would witness a full solar eclipse as \"Io\" passes in front of the Sun. Landing site in sight Sept. 30, 2016 was a bitter-sweet day for space exploration: the incredible Rosetta spacecraft reached the end of its hugely successful mission, fittingly, by touching down on the surface of the comet it had been studying from orbit for the previous two years. This image was captured by the spacecraft s wide-angle OSIRIS camera during the final hour of the mission. Cosmic jellyfish Using the detailed eyes of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and ESO s Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have mapped the intense tails of a cosmic jellyfish: a number of knotty streams of gas spewing outwards from a spiral galaxy named ESO 137-001. Beacon of light This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the galaxy Messier 86. Despite its being discovered over 235 years ago by astronomer Charles Messier, the morphological classification of Messier 86 remains unclear. Astronomers are still debating over whether it is either elliptical or lenticular (the latter being a cross between an elliptical and spiral galaxy). Stuck on the rings Like a drop of dew hanging on a leaf, Tethys appears to be stuck to the A and F rings from this perspective. Tethys (660 miles, or 1,062 kilometers across), like the ring particles, is composed primarily of ice. The gap in the A ring through which Tethys is visible is the Keeler gap, which is kept clear by the small moon Daphnis (not visible here). This view looks toward the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Tethys. North on Tethys is up and rotated 43 degrees to the right. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 14, 2014. Primitive one This artist\\'s conception illustrates one of the most primitive supermassive black holes known (central black dot) at the core of a young, star-rich galaxy. Mars underground exposed The most habitable places on Mars now and in the past are underground, where water is or was much more stable than at the surface and protected from energetic particle radiation. Large impact craters have central rebounds that uplift buried strata from miles below the surface. Often these central uplifts reveal colorful rocks with diverse minerals, including ones altered by prolonged contact with water. Alga Crater is located in the southern highlands near a large flood-channel called Ladon Valles. Illuminating space A galaxy called ESO 243-49, is home to an extremely bright object called HLX-1. Circled in this image, HLX-1 is the most likely example of a black hole in the intermediate mass range that scientists have found. The source was discovered at the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie (IRAP, formerly the CESR), Toulouse, France and gained interest from the scientific community because of strong evidence supporting it as an intermediate-mass black hole. HLX-1 is possibly the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that may have been in a galactic collision with ESO 243-49. Bonus beauty The steep walls of the crater are covered with slope streaks formed by material falling down towards the crater\\'s center. There are so many in this case that the crater is reminiscent of a delicate \"dandelion clock.\"Â\\x9d Looking closer, we can also see that the exposed layering gives us more information about the subsurface of Mars. Sourcing ultraluminous X-ray This image, taken with the European Southern Observatory\\'s Very Large Telescope, shows the central region of galaxy NGC1313. This galaxy is home to the ultraluminous X-ray source NCG1313X-1, which astronomers have now determined to be an intermediate-mass black hole candidate. NGC1313 is 50,000 light-years across and lies about 14 million light-years from the Milky Way in the southern constellation Reticulum. Crater on Mars Debris in space often impacts planets, and on Mars, we are finding new craters from recent impacts. The meteorite that caused the small crater, just seven meters across, hit Mars sometime between April 2018 and January 2019. Context Camera images are used to identify changes in large areas and then HiRISE images are scheduled to verify that there is, indeed, a new crater on Mars. Subliming Ice This image shows a 45-meter-diameter crater that formed sometime between October 2010 and May 2012 in so-called \"brain\"Â terrain on Mars. HiRISE has been monitoring this crater to look for changes in the bright icy material exposed in the crater wall and some of the ejecta blocks. This material is interpreted as water ice because its extent changes with time, consistent with slow sublimation caused by solar heating. Man meets Milky Way Picture showcases the bulging heart of the Milky Way as it hangs over the Chajnantor plateau. Located in the Atacama Desert of Chile, this plateau is one of the highest and driest places on Earth. Into the deep This week six astronauts turned \\'cavenauts\\' from five space agencies headed underground in Slovenia, where they are currently living and working for the week. To keep the element of exploration, astronauts themselves do not know the exact location. The goal is to run scientific experiments while managing the psychological toll of being in an extreme environment with a multinational crew. Expedition 61 Soyuz rollout The gantry arms close around the Soyuz rocket after it was raised into vertical position on the launch pad, Monday, Sept. 23, 2019 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Not so dead after all Many of the best-loved galaxies in the cosmos are remarkably large, close, massive, bright, or beautiful, often with an unusual or intriguing structure or history. However, it takes all kinds to make a Universe   as demonstrated by this Hubble Picture of the Week of Messier 110. Clarence Strait, Australia The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission takes us over Clarence Strait, a narrow body of water in Australia\\'s Northern Territory. Milky Way Milky Way panorama taken in the Armazones crater site in Chile by the Extremely Large Telescope site. Close Encounter With Saturn The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope\\'s Wide Field Camera 3 observed Saturn on June 20, 2019 as the planet made its closest approach to Earth this year, approximately 845 million miles away. Aurora Now At the remote Concordia research station in Antarctica, a beautiful and harmless display of Aurora Australis or Southern Lights caught ESA-sponsored medical doctor Nadja Albertsen by surprise. Interstellar Comet This illustration depicts Comet C/2019 Q4\\'s trajectory. Deemed a possible interstellar object, it will approach no closer to Earth than about 190 million miles (300 million kilometers). The newly discovered comet has excited the astronomical community this week because it appears to have originated from outside the solar system. Southern Stars Part of the southern Milky Way is seen here, around the constellations of Centaurus, Crux and Carina. Mars\\' Icy Dunes This image was taken in the north polar region of Mars by the ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter s CaSSIS camera. Dunes come in various characteristic shapes on Mars just as on Earth, providing clues about the prevailing wind direction. CubeSat Mission to Lunar Orbit The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) is expected to be the first spacecraft to operate in a near rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon. In this unique orbit, the CubeSat will rotate together with the Moon as it orbits Earth and will pass as close as 1,000 miles and as far as 43,500 miles from the lunar surface. Milky Way Milky Way panorama taken in Chile at the Extremely Large Telescope site. The white band of light is a swirling galaxy of dust, stars and 30 constellations. Preparing for Mission NASA continued its preparation for the Artemis I mission with a successful water flow test on the mobile launcher at Kennedy Space Center\\'s Pad 39B on Friday, Sept. 13. Dark Matter in Whale\\'s Belly This image, taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, focuses on an object named UGC 695, which is located 30 million light-years away within the constellation Cetus (The Sea Monster), also known as The Whale. UGC 695 is a low-surface-brightness (LSB) galaxy. These galaxies are so faint that their brightness is less than the background brightness of Earth s atmosphere, which makes them tricky to observe. This low brightness is the result of the relatively small number of stars within them. Asteroids Fly by Earth Two medium-sized asteroids flew safely past Earth overnight Sept. 13-14 (Eastern U.S. time).  These asteroids have been well observed once since 2000 and the other since 2010 and their orbits are very well known,  said Lindley Johnson, planetary defense officer and program executive for the Planetary Defense Coordination Office at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Magellanic Cloud ESO\\'s VISTA telescope reveals a remarkable image of the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of our nearest galactic neighbours. VISTA has been surveying this galaxy and its sibling the Small Magellanic Cloud, as well as their surroundings, in unprecedented detail. This survey allows astronomers to observe a large number of stars, opening up new opportunities to study stellar evolution, galactic dynamics, and variable stars. Water World This artist s impression shows the planet K2-18b, its host star and an accompanying planet in this system. K2-18b is now the only super-Earth exoplanet known to host both water and temperatures that could support life. With data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a super-Earth within the habitable zone by University College London (UCL) researchers in a world first. K2-18b, which is eight times the mass of Earth, is now the only planet orbiting a star outside the Solar System, or exoplanet, known to have both water and temperatures that could support life. Titan\\'s Rimmed Lakes This artist\\'s concept of a lake at the north pole of Saturn\\'s moon Titan illustrates raised rims and rampartlike features such as those seen by NASA\\'s Cassini spacecraft around the moon\\'s Winnipeg Lacus. Hubble\\'s legacy This picture shows a dwarf galaxy named UGC 685. Such galaxies are small and contain just a tiny fraction of the number of stars in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Dwarf galaxies often show a hazy structure, an ill-defined shape, and an appearance somewhat akin to a swarm or cloud of stars   and UGC 685 is no exception to this. Classified as an SAm galaxy   a type of unbarred spiral galaxy   it is located about 15 million light-years from Earth. Remembering September 11 This 2019 photo of Manhattan, taken by astronaut Nick Hague from aboard the International Space Station, shows Manhattan as it looks today, 18 years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Banishing Light Pollution This image features the Milky Way rising over the Residencia at ESO\\'s Paranal Observatory, which can be seen atop a mountain in the distance. This photograph was taken by ESO Photo Ambassador Petr Horálek, and is a great demonstration of just how artificial light can pollute its environment   the brightness of the Residencia lights seems almost blinding compared to the stars. Artificial light scatters off the particles in our atmosphere and can drown out the night sky. Cyclones from Space On Sept. 4, 2019, a loose chain of tropical cyclones lined up across the Western Hemisphere. At the time of this image (1:10 p.m. EDT) Hurricane Juliette in the East Pacific and Hurricane Dorian in the Atlantic were both category 2 storms. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fernand packed sustained winds of 45 mph and had just recently made landfall over northeastern Mexico. Gabrielle strengthened into a tropical storm on September 4 over the eastern Atlantic, and had sustained winds of 50 mph around the time of this image. Mystery in Fireworks Galaxy This visible-light image of the Fireworks galaxy (NGC 6946) comes from the Digital Sky Survey and is overlaid with data from NASA\\'s NuSTAR observatory (shown in blue and green). Blue light indicates X-rays captured during the first of two observations by NuSTAR, in May 2017. Green light indicates X-rays seen less than two weeks later in the second observation. This means that the source of the green spot to the lower left of the galactic center began radiating in the time between those two observations. Two bright sources near the top of the image show a combination of blue and green, indicating those sources were visible during both observations. The X-ray data don\\'t have the same spatial resolution as the visible-light image, so the X-ray sources appear larger. Avalanche Season on Mars Every spring the sun shines on the side of the stack of layers at the North Pole of Mars known as the north polar layered deposits. The warmth destabilizes the ice and blocks break loose. When they reach the bottom of the more than 500 meter tall cliff face, the blocks kick up a cloud of dust. The layers beneath are different colors and textures depending on the amount of dust mixed with ice.\\n']"
